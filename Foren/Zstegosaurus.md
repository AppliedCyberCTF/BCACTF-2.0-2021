## Challenge

> My friend forgot our pet zstegosaurus's name. Luckily for him, I hid the dinosaur's name somewhere in this picture...but now I can't find it. Can you help us?

## Solution

If we open the image in [stegsolve](https://github.com/eugenekolo/sec-tools/tree/master/stego/stegsolve/stegsolve), we'll notice a little bit of noise in the red 0 bit plane.
